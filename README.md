Tags : ETL, Unsupervised Learning, Clustering, Recommendation system, Interpretation

Time Spent: 1day

 content : An exploration of Kendrick Lamar's music including : 
- Data cleaning
- First quick analysis
- Definition of 3 clusters for different type of songs + interpretation and analysis 
- Construction of a recommendation system based on the clustering

Important precision : 
Because I used dynamic visuals with plot.express, some visuals are not displayed in the GitHub preview. You can find them in the folder "Interactive visuals" which includes for instance a 3D representation of the clustering. 

Hope you will enjoy !
